started with running the app1.py and opening the URL link

next I created a dockerfile (attached) and ran the commands:

" docker build -t app1:1 . " ->
" docker run -d --name docker_is_the_best app1:1 "

next I stopped the container using: " docker container stop 55e30ac417ad "

and removed the container using: " docker container rm docker_is_the_best "


after that I ran: " docker run -d -v ${PWD}\logs:/app/logs -p 5000:5000 --name docker_is_the_best app1:1 "

and it worked.
