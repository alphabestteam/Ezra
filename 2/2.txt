1.  The object that's in charge of connecting between the 2
    deployments is the service object.

2.  once created the service files we'll run:
        "kubectl apply -f frontend-service.yaml" - to apply the frontend-service file
        "kubectl apply -f backend-service.yaml" - to apply the backend-service file

    in order to see all services will run "kubectl get services".
