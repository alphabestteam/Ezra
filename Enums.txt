1. A enum is a class that allows you to define your own values to other values, so for example:

class Weekday(Enum):
    sunday = 1
    monday = 2
    tuesday = 3
    ...

# Access enum members
print(Weekday.sunday)  # 1


2. we would want to use enums if we want to group a bunch of values. giving it a distinct pro over regular values, 
you can limit the user to certain properties, and you can give them specific attributes.
