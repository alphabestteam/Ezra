1.  the right object for us to use would be the Ingress object.
    the point of the ingress object is to "expose HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside
    the cluster to services within the cluster"
    basically saying that the Ingress is the object that will make the cluster accessible by 
    the internet user.

2.  once i've created the ingress file, i need to run it, 
    1. minikube start
    2. kubectl get svc (to make sure the service is running)
    3. minikube service frontend-service --url
    4. click on the url that they give you
