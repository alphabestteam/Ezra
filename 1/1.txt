a.  2 ways to create a logical work environment:
    1.  using a YAML file
    2.  using the k8s CLI (kubectl create namespace <namespace-name>)


b.  in order to upload the app to the cluster i'm going to create 2 
    yaml deployment files, one for the backend and one for the frontend.

    once i've created them i'll run:
        kubectl apply -f frontend-deployment.yaml - to "save" the frontend yaml file
        kubectl apply -f backend-deployment.yaml - to "save" the backend yaml file

    after that we can view all pods by typing "kubectl get pods" and it will show us 
    a list of pods with all it's stats (that's were we can see if it's running)


    the reason that I chose each pod to run 3 times is because that way there's more
    availability, so if one of them crashes the others will take it's place.
    as well having 3 pods allows k8s to distribute traffic more evenly.

    However, I won't create more than that, because it will cost to much.


    * i'm not creating a custom network because k8s deals with the pods networks in a very good way.
