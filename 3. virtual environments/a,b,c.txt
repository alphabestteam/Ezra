a.  a virtual environment is a way for us to run code in a
safe space. it created a virtual space for us to run code.

they're useful for us for example if we have some projects that
need to be run in an older version, so we'd run them on the virtual environment where we'll
install the needed version.
another example why a virtual environment would be useful,
if we want to play with version of a program but we're scared that it
might change things on the computer, we'll do those playing withs in the virtual environment.


b.  the way virtual environment work is that they create a copy of the computer and allow you to
work on the virtual environment without changing things on the actual computer.
