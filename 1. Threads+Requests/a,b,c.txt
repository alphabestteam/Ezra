a.  Normally the code will run line by line, however, sometime
we want to run some things at the same time. Threads are a way
for us to run to part of the code at the same time.
for example, if we have a server running and we'd like to run
other things at the same time.


b.  we'll use the threading library in order achieve threading.


c.  the requests library is a library that's in charge of dealing
with anything to do with sending/receiving/deleting things from the HTTP
we'd use requests over sockets because sockets is mainly used for simple
things that don't need a specific protocol (HTTP). but requests is much more
flexible.
