1.  list comprehension is what you shorten creating a new list from an old list.
so for example, if you have an old list of cars, and you want to create a new list 
that contains only cars that have the letter 'o' in them.

so without list comprehension you would need to do a for loop:

    cars = ['volvo', 'ford', 'mustang', 'chevi', 'opal']
    new_list_of_cars = []

    for car in cars:
        if 'o' in car:
            new_list_of_cars.append(car)


however with list comprehension you can shorten that down to one line:

    new_list_of_cars[car for car in cars if 'o' in car]

the syntax is as following:

    newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]



2.  you don't need to use list comprehension, although it's a nice feature to know.
