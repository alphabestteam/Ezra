first step is to install tomcat:
" docker pull tomcat"

next we need to create a container with tomcat:
" docker run -d -p 8080:8080 tomcat "

to fix the 404 error we need to move the ~/webapps inside the container,

I ran these commands once after another:

" docker exec -it mytomcat /bin/bash "
" mv webapps webapps2 "
" mv webapps.dist/ webapps "
" exit "


to create the custom image for the tomcat, i'll open a dockerfile (as shown)
and add the code.

after that i'll build the dockerfile:

" docker build -t custom-tomcat . "

then i'll run it:

" docker run -d -p 8080:8080 custom-tomcat "
