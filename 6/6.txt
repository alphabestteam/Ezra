Q1: how does the layers mechanism speed the development time?

A:  layers is the collection of all the commands that we're running
    when we're creating an image (from, copy, cmd, workdir...).
    every command/instruction is translated to an image layer.

    this can speed up the development time because the way the layers work
    is that if it ran a layer and it worked it won't run that layer again unless
    it's been changed. making the development time much faster.


Q2: which way is better?

    RUN echo Hello i am the 'a' file > a &&\
        echo Hello i am the 'b' file > c &&\
        echo Hello i am the 'c' file > b &&\

    RUN echo Hello i am the 'a' file > a
    RUN echo Hello i am the 'b' file > c 
    RUN echo Hello i am the 'c' file > b

A:  I think the second way with the multiple runs is better, because
    this way if one of them is changed we don't need to rerun all 3 of them,
    rather just the changed one.


Q3: how can i check how many layers are in an image?
A:  I used the command: 'docker history <image_name>' and that returns all the layers in said image.
