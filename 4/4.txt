the issue with how we created the environment variables
is that if we create a lot of variables or if theres sensitive
info, dealing with them in the yaml can become annoying.

so to deal with such issues it's good practice to create ConfigMaps and Secretes
ConfigMaps - stores data in key-value pairs.
Secretes - holds sensitive data.

I created 3 files: ConfigMaps-backend, ConfigMaps-frontend, secret-frontend
once they're created we'll change the deployment files accordantly.
once all files are changed we'll apply the deployment files and restart the url link.
