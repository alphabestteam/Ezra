1.  version: "3.8"  - docker version

services:   - the containers that we're building
  mongo:    - name of the first container
    image: mongo:latest - what image you should read
    container_name: mongo   - the container name
    environment:    - setting the environment variables
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: admin 
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: admin
    ports:  - setting the ports
      - "27017:27017" 
    volumes:    - creating the ports
      - type: volume    
        source: MONGO_DATA  - getting the source for the volume
        target: /data/db    - where in the container the volume should connect to
      - type: volume
        source: MONGO_CONFIG
        target: /data/configdb
        
  mongo-express:
    image: mongo-express:latest
    container_name: mongo-express
    environment:
      ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME: admin
      ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD: admin
      ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER: mongo
      ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_PORT: "27017"


volumes:
  MONGO_DATA:
    name: MONGO_DATA
  MONGO_CONFIG:
    name: MONGO_CONFIG


2.  it's not finding the page because we didn't declare the port number (8081:8081)

3.  I added - 
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
    to the mongo-express section.

4. to take down the whole environment you would run " docker-compose down "


part 2

1. the way to config the var in a better way is by using the .env file.
