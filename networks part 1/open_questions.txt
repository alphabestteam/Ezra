Q:  what is a switch? and what issues does it fix?
A:  A switch is a device that works on the 2nd level and it's job is 
    to handle packages that come in and decide which package goes to what computer.
    the issue that it helps fixing is issues of package collisions and sending the right
    package to the right computer. 

    Q:  how does a switch know to which physical interface it should send each package?
    A:  on every package there's a receiving mac address then the sending mac address, 
        so the switch sees the receiving mac address and checks if he has that mac address
        in his books (asks around) and based on that he will send it out.
