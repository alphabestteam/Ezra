1.  the reason we don't save everything in variables in the code, is because it would cause a huge 
mess. imagine you have a 300 page book that you want to use in the code, you can't just go and put in a variable.
In general saving info out of the code in separate areas allows you to keep things in order, and it doesn't restrict
the usage of the file to your code. 
so for example a word document can be used for multiple things besides in the code.
more than that, it allows you to store info out of the code, so even when the code stops running you will still have 
the info saved somewhere.


2.  in python if we want to open an external file we'll you the open() function. 
the syntax of the open() function:

        f = open("file_path.pdf", "mode")
        print(f.read)

in the first section you put the file path including the type (pdf, jpg...)
and in the second section you put the mode of the file.
there are 4 kinds of mode:

"r" - Read, default value, it opens the file for reading and will return an error if the file doesn't exist
"a" - Append, It will open the file for appending and will create the file if it doesn't exist.
"w" - Write, It will open the file for writing and will create the file if it doesn't exit.
"x" - Create, It will create the specified file, and will return if the file exists.

besides that you can specify how the file should be handled (binary/txt mode)

"t" - Text, default value. Text mode
"b" - binary mode (images, videos...)

you can attach the modes together, so for example "rb" will read the file as binary.
