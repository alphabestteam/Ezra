a.  a generator is a function that doesn't return a value rather it returns
values using the yield method. the main difference between return and yield is that
return returns a singular value at the end of the function where as yield can return
a bunch of values in difference areas of the function.


b.  3 reasons why we'd prefer to use generators.
    1. it's great from memory saving
    2. it's amazing if you want to return a bunch of values
    3. it's good if you want to return values at different times through the code.


c.  we'd want to save a generator in a variable in a case where we'd want to call the
function a couple of times throughout the code. so for example,
if i have a list and i'd like to print it out multiple times throughout the code but with
changes in it.


d.  as explained in 'a.' yield is a kind of return but it allows the function to run after it returns it's values
it also allows to return multiple values, unlike return that only allows to return one value and only at the
end of the function.
