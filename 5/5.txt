1.  if we want to scale the amount of backend pods, we'll use the 
    scale command.

        "kubectl scale deployment backend-deployment --replicas=5"

2.
        "kubectl scale deployment frontend-deployment --replicas=5"

3.  the point of the scale command is to create more pods.
    we'd create more pods if we want to scale the program and have more 
    pods running at once, or the opposite, if you know that there's a down time
    and you don't need as many pods, you can down scale the pods.
    those are 2 of the many common uses of the scale command.
