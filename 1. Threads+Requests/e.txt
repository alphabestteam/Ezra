e.  sometimes when you have multiple threads running at the same time
they will try and access the same info at the same time, and that can
cause an issue because they can change the info and that will cause an
error to rise, that part of code is called a critical zone.
What one can do is lock that critical zone and allow only a thread at a time
into that critical zone.
