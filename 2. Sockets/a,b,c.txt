a.  sockets is way to connect between 2 computers on the networks.
we won't use sockets for connecting to a network area.
the alternative for that would be Requests.


b.  1.  the server creates a socket,
    2.  it binds the address and the port
    3.  opens a listen session
    4.  the user creates a socket
    5.  the user connects to a different socket that's listening on a certain address and port (server)
    6.  the user "sendall" request to the server to send all the info that he has
    7.  the server receives "Recv" the info from the user.
    8.  (optional) the server can "sendall" back to the user.
    9.  (optional based on 8) the user will "Recv".


c.  1.  address Family - the socket Family that the socket is trying to contact. (Af_INET - IPv4, Af_INET - IPv6, AF_UNIX)
    2.  the kind of connection - TCP/UDP (TCP (reliable and ordered) - SOCK_STREAM, UDP (less reliable but faster) - SOCK_DGRAM)
