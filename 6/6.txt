1.  i've added an image showing the cpu and memory usage.
    to get to there I first needed to enable metrics-server:
    
        "minikube addons enable metrics-server"

    once that was done I could view the stats by running:

        "kubectl top pods"


2.  To limit the resources for a pod we'll do so in the deployment.yaml file. (see changes)

    i've started off the resources at the highest number that a pod has by default.
    and i've set a limit on the conservative side. However, if i see that the program doesn't 
    reach that limit ever, i'll decrease the limit, and vise versa.
